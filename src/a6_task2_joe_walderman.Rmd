## Intro and Data

This dataset is from an online survey of 1,331 Americans accross the country collected in 2017 covering a variety of topics. This report utilizes two of these topics, one saying "I considering myself an environmentalist" and providing response options, the other asking "how do you self-identify politically?". A Chi-Square test is utilized to assess if there is an association between political affiliation and if a person considers themselves an environmentalist.



```{r}
## Reading in and cleaning data

survey <- read.csv(here("data", "conservation_survey.csv"))

survey_clean <- survey %>% 
  clean_names()
```


```{r}
## Making a subset and mutating

survey_env <- survey_clean %>% 
  select(env_id, pol_or) %>%
  mutate(affiliation = case_when(
    pol_or %in% c(1, 2, 3) ~ "Conservative",
    pol_or %in% c(5, 6, 7) ~ "Liberal",
  )) %>% 
  mutate(enviro = case_when(
    env_id == 1 ~ "Yes",
    env_id == 2 ~ "No",
    env_id == 3 ~ "Unsure"
  )) %>% 
  drop_na() # excluding observations with NA affiliation values
```

## Analysis

**Table 1** Counts and Proportions of conservative and liberal respondents who indicated "Yes", "No", and "Unsure" to the prompted statement "I consider myself an environmentalist. Over 50% of those who identified as conservative responded that they were explicitly not environmentalists, while over 50% of environmentalists responded that they explicitly were environmentalists. Data: Andrews Forest LTER Site and C. Batavia. 2019.

```{r}
## Find counts and proportions of liberal and conservative identifying survey responders responding no, unsure, or yes to a question about whether they consinder themselves an environmentalist 

#survey_env %>% count(affiliation, enviro)

survey_counts <- survey_env %>% 
  tabyl(affiliation, enviro)

survey_proportions <- survey_counts %>% 
  adorn_percentages() %>% # showing percentage of people surveyed from each party responding no, unsure, or yes to environmentalist question
  adorn_pct_formatting(digits = 2) %>% # rounding decimals
  adorn_ns() %>% # actual counts in each cell as well in parenthesis
  select(1,4,2,3) #reordering columns

#Styling table

survey_proportions %>% 
  kable(col.names = c("", "Yes", "No", "Unsure")) %>% 
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = "striped", full_width = FALSE)
```





```{r}
## Contingency table

survey_ct <- survey_counts %>% 
  column_to_rownames(var = "affiliation") %>% #Pulling column information into rownames so now I just have two columns and ready to be fed into chi sqrd
  select(Yes, No, Unsure) # Reordering columns
```



```{r}
## Chi-square test: is there an association between political affiliation and if a person considers themself an environmentalist? In other words, are political affiliation and identification as an environmentalist independent?

survey_x2 <- chisq.test(survey_ct)
survey_x2_tidy <- tidy(survey_x2)


```

The majority of people who identified as liberal identify as environmentalists and the majority of people who identified as conservative explicitly do not identify environmentalists. There is a significant association between political affiliation and identification as an environmentalist ($\chi$^2^(`r round(survey_x2_tidy$parameter,1)`) = `r round(survey_x2_tidy$statistic,2)`, *p* = `r round(survey_x2_tidy$p.value,3)`), meaning these two variables are dependent.
